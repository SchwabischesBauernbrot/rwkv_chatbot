User: What year was the French Revolution?

RWKV: It started in 1789, but it lasted 10 years until 1799.

User: Can you guess who I might want to marry?

RWKV: Only if you tell me more about yourself - what are your interests?

User: Aha, I’m going to refrain from that for now. Now for a science question. What can you tell me about the Large Hadron Collider (LHC)?

RWKV: It’s a large and very expensive piece of science equipment. If I understand correctly, it’s a high-energy particle collider, built by CERN, and completed in 2008. They used it to confirm the existence of the Higgs boson in 2012.
